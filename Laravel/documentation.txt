#Server Requirements

The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. Of course, all of these requirements are satisfied by the Laravel Homestead 
virtual machine, so it's highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.

However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

<li>PHP >= 5.5.9</li>
<li>OpenSSL PHP Extension</li>
<li>PDO PHP Extension</li>
<li>Mbstring PHP Extension</li>
<li>Tokenizer PHP Extension</li>

#Installing Composer

Laravel utilizes Composer to manage its dependencies. So, before using Laravel, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.
https://getcomposer.org/download/

#Installing Laravel
Via Laravel Installer

First, download the Laravel installer using Composer:

composer global require "laravel/installer"
Make sure to place the ~/.composer/vendor/bin directory (or the equivalent directory for your OS) in your PATH so the laravel executable can be located by your system.

Once installed, the laravel new command will create a fresh Laravel installation in the directory you specify. For instance, laravel new blog will create a directory named blog containing a fresh Laravel installation with all of Laravel's dependencies already installed. This method of installation is much faster than installing via Composer:

laravel new name-aplication

Now you can change all the blog paste to another one and start your project with:
php artisan server
Make sure to place the where you fixed your new applicatin.
